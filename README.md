# Bookmarks

This is a small project from me to organize my bookmarks.

## Setup

1. Make sure you have installed npm and angular cli.
2. Run `npm install`
3. Create a `packages/backend/.env` file according to the `.env.example` file in this directory.
4. Setup the prisma database with `npm run database --workspace @narflympics/backend`
5. Run `npm start`
